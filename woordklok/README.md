# Word clock
In this project a word clock is made. It shows the current time in text through a 16x16 matrix.

## Materials

- Arduino Uno
- 16Ã—16 neopixel matrix
- DS1307 RTC module

## How to

This project contains several svg files for a laser cutter. These layers go on top of the LED matrix. 

The RTC module and Neopixel matrix are connected to the Arduino. The code is included with a .ino file. 

It is possible to use a different Arduino or RTC module, but the pin numbers then need to be adjusted or the RTC library related code.
